    "***Answer:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment:\n",
    "It serves as a straightforward and memory-conserving approach for generating a copy when we want two references to identical data\n",
    "It entails establishing a new reference to an already-existing object\n",
    "Both the initial object and the copy point the identical memory location\n",
    "If we change one object, it will impact the other since they essentially represent the identical objet\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "My_original_wave_periods = [1, 4, 2, 3]\n",
    "# Assignment\n",
    "copied_wave_periods = My_original_wave_periods \n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow copy:\n",
    "It produces a new object that mimics the structure of the original object at the top level. However, it doesn't duplicate the objects nested within the original. Instead, it shares references to these nested objects between the original and the copy. Consequently, modifications made to nested objects within the original can influence the copy, and vice versa\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "My_original_wave_periods = [1, 4, [2, 3]]\n",
    "# Shallow copy\n",
    "shallow_copied_wave_periods = copy.copy(My_original_wave_periods)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep copy:\n",
    "It goes further by producing a fully independent duplicate of the original object, including all objects nested inside it. It replicates both the top-level object and all its nested components, doing so recursively. Importantly, any changes made to the original or its nested objects have no impact on the deep copy, and vice versa. In essence, they become entirely separate objects with no shared references.\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "My_original_wave_periods = [1, 4, [2, 3]]\n",
    "# Deep copy\n",
    "deep_copied_wave_periods = copy.deepcopy(My_original_wave_periods)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, assignment creates a reference to the same object, shallow copy creates a new object with shared references to nested objects, and deep copy creates a new object with copies of all nested objects, ensuring complete independence between the original and the copy\n",
